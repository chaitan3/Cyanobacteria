Check temperature compensation
Check the various biochemical models
Steps altering the time period
1. Phosphorylation rate: amount of ATP, kaiA
2. Rate of kaiB binding: amount of kaiB
3. Dephosphorylaton rate: ?
kaiC monomer exchange for population synchronization

bioinformatics Analysis Conclusions
1. kaiB: closest is kaiB1 then B2, B4
B3 very different and much bigger
2. kaiC1, C2 both have the ST 431,432 residues
kaiC2 doesnt seem to have the C-terminal domain
3. kaiC II C-terminal domain ring, S-loop T495->E487
kaiC1 has S in T495 position sort of match
kaiC2 has no matching aa's in T495 and E487
4. Longer kaiB may not bind in pairs to kaiC 

microRNA
1. RNA transcription peaks at start of transcript
2. mRNA transript structure. CAP - 5' UTR - Start - Codons - Stop - 3' UTR - Poly AA
3. Promoter, RNA polymerase
4. 5' UTR contains regulatory elements, RBS
5. Some non coding transcripts show circadian oscillations in expression
6. Large distance between TSS and start codon indicates regulation
7. Why can't everyone use the same terminology
8. check Yfr2
9. check SyR1, high light strong expression, overexpression severe phenotype
10. asRNA in psbA, anti sense block inhibition

Steps
1. microRNA compare it with RFAM 
2. asRNA sequence
3. RNA transcripts whose Expression pattern is opposite to that of psbA1
Check with genes: known which are opposite related to metabolism
sigma factors, known promoters

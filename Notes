Check temperature compensation
Check the various biochemical models
Steps altering the time period
1. Phosphorylation rate: amount of ATP, kaiA
2. Rate of kaiB binding: amount of kaiB
3. Dephosphorylaton rate: ?
kaiC monomer exchange for population synchronization

bioinformatics Analysis Conclusions
1. kaiB: closest is kaiB1 then B2, B4
B3 very different and much bigger
2. kaiC1, C2 both have the ST 431,432 residues
kaiC2 doesnt seem to have the C-terminal domain
3. kaiC II C-terminal domain ring, S-loop T495->E487
kaiC1 has S in T495 position sort of match
kaiC2 has no matching aa's in T495 and E487
4. Longer kaiB may not bind in pairs to kaiC 

microRNA
2. mRNA transript structure. CAP - 5' UTR - Start - Codons - Stop - 3' UTR - Poly AA
4. 5' UTR contains regulatory elements, RBS
5. Some non coding transcripts show circadian oscillations in expression
6. Large distance between TSS and start codon indicates regulation
8. check Yfr2
9. check SyR1, high light strong expression, overexpression severe phenotype
10. asRNA in psbA, anti sense block inhibition

Todo
Get RNA sequencing data and get the 5' UTR region for genes like psbA
Make pics for kaiABC, purF
Analysis of the pics
Answer Promoter->microRNA->Phenotype correlation for elongatus and extend to Cyanothece.

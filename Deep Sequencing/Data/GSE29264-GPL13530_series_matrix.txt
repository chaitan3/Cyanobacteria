!Series_summary	"Previous molecular and mechanistic studies have identified several principles of prokaryotic transcription, but less is known about the global transcriptional architecture of bacterial genomes. Here we perform a comprehensive study of a cyanobacterial transcriptome, that of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, generated by combining three high-resolution data sets: RNA sequencing, tiling expression microarrays, and RNA polymerase chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing."
!Series_summary	"We report absolute transcript levels, operon identification, and high-resolution mapping of 5' and 3' ends of transcripts. We identify several interesting features at promoters, within transcripts and in terminators relating to transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. Furthermore, we identify many putative non-coding transcripts."
!Series_summary	"We provide a global analysis of a cyanobacterial transcriptome. Our results uncover insights that reinforce and extend the current views of bacterial transcription."

RNA was extracted from frozen cells in two steps. First, cells were lysed in 65 C phenol/SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) by vortexing and total RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. Second, total RNA was subjected to DNase I treatment followed by a second phenol/chloroform extraction. Total RNA was analyzed on agarose gel and Agilent Bioanalyzer to assess integrity. Total RNA was prepared for timepoints collected at 4 hour intervals from 76 to 96 hours after release into continuous light and mixed in equal proportions.

Fragmentation reactions were immediately precipitated in 300 mM NaOAc, pH 5.2, glycogen, and isopropanol. Fragmented RNA was resuspended in RNA loading buffer (Fisher), briefly denatured, and loaded in a 15% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) for size selection. Gels were stained with Sybr Gold (Invitrogen) and a 25-30 nucleotide band was excised using a synthesized 28 nucleotide RNA and denatured 10 base-pair DNA ladder (Invitrogen) as standards. The gel slice was physically disrupted and RNA was recovered in 300 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 units/ul SUPERase-In (Ambion) overnight at room temperature. Solution was transferred to a Spin-X cellulose acetate filter (Corning) to remove gel debris and precipitated with glycogen and isopropanol. Size selected fragmented RNA was denatured briefly and dephosphorylated in a 30 ul reaction with 1 X T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer without ATP (NEB), 20 units SUPERase-In, and 15 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) at 37 C for 1 hour. The reaction was precipitated, resuspended, briefly denatured, and poly-(A) tailed in a 25 ul reaction with 1 X poly-(A) polymerase buffer (NEB), 5 units SUPERase-In, 1 mM ATP, and 1.25 units E. coli poly-(A) polymerase (NEB) at 37 C for 10 minutes. Reactions were quenched with 80 ul of 5 mM EDTA and precipitated.  Reverse transcription was carried out from the introduced poly-(A) tail anchor of denatured RNA using primer oNTI255 with the SuperScript III reverse-transcriptase system (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 units/ul of SUPERase-In at 48 C for 30 minutes. RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed in 0.1 M NaOH at 98 C for 15 minutes and loaded in a 10% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) and the extended first-strand product was excised and recovered as above in 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA. First-strand cDNA was circularized in a 20 ul reaction with 1 X CircLigase buffer (Epientre), 50 uM ATP, 2.5 mM MnCl2, and 1 ul CircLigase (Epientre) for 1 hour at 60 C, and then heat-inactivated 10 minutes at 80 C.  One ul of circularized cDNA template was amplified using Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) and primers oNTI230 and oNTI231 to create DNA with Illumina cluster generation sequences on each end along with the Illumina small RNA sequencing primer binding site. PCR was carried out with an initial 30 second denaturation at 98 C, followed by 8 cycles of 10 second denaturation at 98 C, 10 second annealing at 60 C, and 5 second extension at 72 C. PCR product was loaded in a non-denaturing 10 % TBE polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) and a 113 to 125 nucleotide band was excised using 10 base-pair ladder as standard. DNA was recovered as previously described. Libraries were quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and 4 to 6 pM of template was used for cluster generation and sequenced on Illumina Genome analyzer II with the Illumina small RNA sequencing primer."

Reverse transcription was carried out from the introduced poly-(A) tail anchor of denatured RNA using primer oNTI255 with the SuperScript III reverse-transcriptase system (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 units/ul of SUPERase-In at 48 C for 30 minutes. RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed in 0.1 M NaOH at 98 C for 15 minutes and loaded in a 10% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) and the extended first-strand product was excised and recovered as above in 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA. First-strand cDNA was circularized in a 20 ul reaction with 1 X CircLigase buffer (Epientre), 50 uM ATP, 2.5 mM MnCl2, and 1 ul CircLigase (Epientre) for 1 hour at 60 C, and then heat-inactivated 10 minutes at 80 C.  One ul of circularized cDNA template was amplified using Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity enzyme (NEB) and primers oNTI230 and oNTI231 to create DNA with Illumina cluster generation sequences on each end along with the Illumina small RNA sequencing primer binding site. PCR was carried out with an initial 30 second denaturation at 98 C, followed by 8 cycles of 10 second denaturation at 98 C, 10 second annealing at 60 C, and 5 second extension at 72 C. PCR product was loaded in a non-denaturing 10 % TBE polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) and a 113 to 125 nucleotide band was excised using 10 base-pair ladder as standard. DNA was recovered as previously described. Libraries were quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and 4 to 6 pM of template was used for cluster generation and sequenced on Illumina Genome analyzer II with the Illumina small RNA sequencing primer."	"Eight ug of RNA was fragmented for 40 minutes at 95 C in fresh 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCO2, pH 9.2. Fragmentation reactions were immediately precipitated in 300 mM NaOAc, pH 5.2, glycogen, and isopropanol. Fragmented RNA was resuspended in RNA loading buffer (Fisher), briefly denatured, and loaded in a 15% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel (BioRad) for size selection. Gels were stained with Sybr Gold (Invitrogen) and a 25-30 nucleotide band was excised using a synthesized 28 nucleotide RNA and denatured 10 base-pair DNA ladder (Invitrogen) as standards. The gel slice was physically disrupted and RNA was recovered in 300 mM NaOAc, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 units/ul SUPERase-In (Ambion) overnight at room temperature. Solution was transferred to a Spin-X cellulose acetate filter (Corning) to remove gel debris and precipitated with glycogen and isopropanol. Size selected fragmented RNA was denatured briefly and dephosphorylated in a 30 ul reaction with 1 X T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer without ATP (NEB), 20 units SUPERase-In, and 15 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) at 37 C for 1 hour. The reaction was precipitated, resuspended, briefly denatured, and poly-(A) tailed in a 25 ul reaction with 1 X poly-(A) polymerase buffer (NEB), 5 units SUPERase-In, 1 mM ATP, and 1.25 units E. coli poly-(A) polymerase (NEB) at 37 C for 10 minutes.

"Cells were mechanically lysed by beat beating with 0.1 mm glass beads in cold lysis buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate) with protease inhibitors (Roche).  Chromatin was fragmented by sonication of the lysate to a median of ~300 base-pairs and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by BCA (Pierce) using BSA as standard. 750 ug of lysate was incubated with 30 ug of antibody - RNA polymerase beta subunit antibody WP023 (Neoclone) or mouse whole IgG mock (Jackson ImmunoResearch) - and incubated overnight at 4 C. We verified that the monoclonal RNA polymerase beta subunit antibody WP023 reacts with S. elongatus RNA polymerase beta by Western blot analysis of whole cell extract, where it produces a single band of the expected size. Lysate was supplemented with Protein G Sepharose Fast-Flow beads (Invitrogen) and incubated for an additional 2 hours at 4 C. After incubation, Sepharose beads were washed in cold buffer at room temperature: 2 x 5 minutes lysis buffer A; 1 x 5 minutes lysis buffer B (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate); 1 x 5 minutes wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate); 1 x 5 minutes TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Protein-DNA was eluted from beads by incubation of samples at 65 C for 1 hour in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1.0% SDS). Crosslinks were reversed in supernatant by incubation of samples at 65 C overnight in elution buffer. Western blot of supernatant of mock versus IP shows 45% efficicency pull-down of the beta subunit and 25% co-IP of beta' subunit in the IP using Neoclone antibodies WP023 and WP001, respectively. Proteins were digested with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K for 2 hours at 37 C.  Nucleic acid was then purified with phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol and LiCl. Nucleic acid was re-suspended in TE buffer and RNA was digested in 20 ug/mL RNase and subsequently phenol/chloroform purified. For input control 5% of the volume of cell lysate was removed after sonication and used to prepare the input DNA.

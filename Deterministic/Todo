Read Susan's redox input paper latest
Read bioprocess reactions All
Meet monday with Sir
Look into which genes responsible for the circadian clock in Cyanothece
KaiBC feedback

Notes:
ldpA mutant shortens period, shorter under high light, longer in low light
cikA required for phasing of the clock, response to dark pulse
cikA mutant shorter period, reduction in amplitude of gene expression rhythms
cikA abundance varies inversely with light intensity
ldpA mutant cikA locked at lowest level, kaiA elevated
DBMIB - photoelectric transport inhibitor, quinone analog
DBMIB decreases stability of ldpA, cikA, kaiA
oxidized DBMID reduces stability of cikA, kaiA

Problems
Too high generation


Verification
kaiA matching - cikA paper
kaiC matching - rhythms paper
response to a dark pulse
back to dark from light

python:
PySCeS for plots?

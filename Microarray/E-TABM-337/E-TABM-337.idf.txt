Protocol Description	The cells were cultivated in alternating 12 hour light/dark conditions. After 7 days, samples were taken every 4 hours over a time period of 48 hours, starting with one hour into the dark period (time point D1). In total, 12 samples were collected. The cells were grown to a cell density of OD730=0.088 (DW2000, SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL). 100 ml cells were collected, spun down by centrifugation at 6000xg, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&deg;C.	Cyanothece cultures were grown in ASP2 medium without NaNO3 in alternating 12 hour light/dark cycles at 30&deg;C. The cultures were bubbled with air and the illumination was 50 &#956;E m-2 s-1. The growth was spectrophotometrically monitored by measuring OD730 on a DW2000 (SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL).	Total RNA was harvested using RNAwiz reagent (Ambion).	2.5 &#956;g of total RNA was labeled using MICROMAX ASAP RNA labeling kit (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences).	750 ng of each labeled RNA with a specific activity 50 pmol DYE/&#956;g RNA was hybridized in 750 &#956;l to each array. Hybridization was performed per manufacturers directions for 16 hours.	Scanning was performed with a Agilent 2565 AA DNA Microarray scanner using defaults parameters (100% PMT, 10 &#956;m resolution, at 20&deg;C in low ozone concentration environment. Microarray images were analyzed by using Feature Extraction software version A.8.1 from Agilent technologies. Defaults settings were used.	Background intensities were subtracted from raw signal intensities to yield the background substracted signals for each spot. Spots with background substracted signal intensities less than +2*sd above the average background intensity were flagged as below the noise threshold, and spots with raw signal intensities above the saturation level were flagged as saturated. These spots were not considered when training the normalization procedure. The background substracted signal intensities were ranked for each channel, and spots that differed by less than +/- 10% rank order between channels were kept for training the normalization. LOWESS fitting of -ln(target/control) vs. ln(control) was performed on the training set, using a window size of 0.25. The fit LOWESS curve was used to correct both the target and control intensities, evenly distributing the corrective scaling between the two channels. Linear interpolation of the scaling factors was used to correct spots that lay between those included in the LOWESS fit. Average log2 ratios for each probe were calculated by averaging all normalized log2 ratios corresponding to spots not flagged as saturated or below the noise level, except for probes for which fewer than two replicates met this criteria, in which case all replicates were used in calculating the average.
